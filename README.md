# CPSC-483-Machine-Learning-Diabetes-Recognition

## Objective
Build a Machine Learning model to predict the likelyhood of diabetes in individuals based on their responses to a questionairre.

## Description
Using the UCI dataset https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset., build a machine learning model to reduce risk in late diabetes diagnoses. The dataset comes from study by the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital in Sylhet, Bangladesh and it was conducted using questionnaires from the patients. The end use case for this machine learning project could be to incorporate the model into an online questionairre. Anyone could fill out the form and the model could recommend the user has a doctor visit if it predicts they are at risk of diabetes.
